# Assignment 4 - Project 2

# How to run the Code files
**Step 1** - To run the files open 5 terminals

**Step 2** - On the first terminal run the 'authentication_server.py' file using command 'python3 authentication_server.py'.

**Step 3** - On the second terminal run the 'time_server.py' file using command 'python3 time_server.py'.

**Step 4** - On the third terminal run the 'ticket_granting_server.py' file using command 'python3 ticket_granting_server.py'.

**Step 5** - On the fourth terminal run the 'service_provider.py' file using command 'python3 service_provider.py'.

**Step 6** - On the fifth terminal run the 'policeman.py' file using command 'python3 policeman.py'.

**Step 7** - Enter Username as 'police' and password as 'password123'

**Step 8** - Two license numbers that can be verified are 'ABC123' and 'XYZ456'

**Note** - The python libraries that are required to run this code are **'socket'** for networking, **'Crypto'** for cryptographic operations, **'pickle'** for serialization, **'time'** for time-related operations, **'datetime'** for handling dates and times, **'base64'** for base64 encoding and decoding, **‘hashlib’** for hashing passwords and **‘fernet’** for Fernet symmetric encryption.
